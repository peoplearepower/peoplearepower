You can clone, star, fork this repository, or let more of our compatriots know what our compatriots are going through, what's going on in this land.
If the act of creating this warehouse is unpatriotic, then why didn't Chen Sheng and Wu Guang love the Qin Empire, and why Zhu Yuanzhang didn't love Yuan Dynasty? Why  Sun Yat-sen didn't love imperial power and the Qing Dynasty? Why Mao Zedong didn't love the Republic of China?
Is patriotism a ruler who loves the land? Is this a strict law of loving the land? The answers to these questions find by your self.
