```
We are orphans in the square
We are the sprouts after the wildfire
We sink to the bottom of the Yangtze River, we are buried under the train
We have ulterior motives on the bus in Guizhou
We are destabilizing in the fires in Urumqi
We are the low-end population wandering in the prosperous age
We are foreign forces shouting in the dark room
We are Hong Kong people who have lost their homes
We are Uighurs who have lost their freedom
We are Liu Xiaobo, we are Tohti
We are Liu Xianbin, we are Chen Wei
We are Cao Shunli and we are Li Wangyang
We are Sun Zhigang, we are Lei Yang
We are Yang Jia, we are Wu Gan
We are Guo Yushan, we are Xu Zhiyong
We are Ai Xiaoming, we are Kou Yanding
We are Lu Xianyu and we are Ye Haiyan
We are Gao Zhisheng, we are Yu Wensheng
We are Xia Lin, we are Wang Yu
We are Li Heping We are Wang Qiaoling
We are Zhang Zhan We are Huang Simin
We are Li Mingzhe, we are Gui Minhai
We are Gao Yaojie, we are Jiang Yanyong
We are Li Wenliang We are Peng Zaizhou
We saved ourselves in the shelter
we are free under chains
we are the deleted voices
we are expelled consciences
We are the last generation of weakness
We are the unnecessary future
can't don't understand don't agree
We stood before the tank
We also stood on the Sidao Bridge
We are still here today
We will stand in front of you tomorrow
Because:
This's my duty

## About this repo
You can clone, star, fork this repository, or let more of our compatriots know what our compatriots are going through, what's going on in this land.
If the act of creating this warehouse is unpatriotic, then why didn't Chen Sheng and Wu Guang love the Qin Empire, and why Zhu Yuanzhang didn't love Yuan Dynasty? Why  Sun Yat-sen didn't love imperial power and the Qing Dynasty? Why Mao Zedong didn't love the Republic of China?
Is patriotism a ruler who loves the land? Is this a strict law of loving the land? The answers to these questions find by your self.
